## Introduction

Welcome to the Clienso project! In this project, I have implemented a Windows Server 2022 environment with various essential services such as Active Directory (AD), Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Internet Information Services (IIS), and Certificate Authority (CA). 

Throughout this project, I will provide an overview of the setup process, configuration steps, and the benefits of each service. By the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how these services work together to create a robust and secure operating system environment.

Let's dive in and explore the world of Windows Server 2022 with AD, DNS, DHCP, IIS, CA, and more!
